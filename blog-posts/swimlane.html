    <h2>A Laser Guided Swimming Lane Aid</h2>

    <p>Story: People with visual impairments can face difficulties staying within their designated l
        anes in a swimming pool for several reasons: </p>
    <p>1. Lack of Visual Cues: Swimming lanes are 
        typically separated by visible lane ropes or markers on the pool floor. People with visual 
        impairments cannot rely on these visual cues to stay in their lanes.</p> 
    <p>2. Spatial Awareness: 
        Swimming requires a good sense of spatial awareness to stay within the confines of a lane. 
        Visual cues help sighted swimmers maintain their orientation, but individuals with visual 
        impairments must rely on other senses and strategies. 
    <p>3. Navigational Challenges: In addition 
        to staying within a lane, swimmers with visual impairments need to navigate the pool safely 
        to avoid collisions with lane ropes, other swimmers, or pool walls.</p>
    <p> 4. Orientation: Swimming 
        in a straight line can be challenging when a swimmer cannot see their surroundings. Without 
        visual references, it's easy to veer off course and move toward the center or sides of the pool. </p>

    <p> Solution: Developing a laser sheet-based guidance system for swimmers with visual impairments to remain 
        within their lanes holds great potential. This innovative system can offer either haptic or 
        auditory cues to assist swimmers in maintaining their orientation while in the pool. The setup 
        requires the installation of two line lasers (parallel beams) in the pool, emitting red laser 
        light within the 650nm to 668nm wavelength range. To make this system work, swimmers will wear 
        two specialized devices equipped with photodiodes, a fresnel lens, and a basic microcontroller 
        unit (MCU) capable of providing haptic feedback. Here's how it functions: As the swimmer 
        approaches the laser line or sheet, the fresnel lens focuses the laser light onto the photodiode. 
        A plastic color filter ensures that the photodiode only reacts to the laser light of a specific 
        wavelength. When the photodiode detects this light, the wearable device immediately delivers 
        haptic feedback to the swimmer, serving as a tactile indicator to help them stay within their 
        lane effectively. This technology represents an exciting innovation that can significantly 
        enhance the swimming experience for individuals with visual impairments, offering them a 
        reliable means of maintaining their course and orientation in the pool.</p>
